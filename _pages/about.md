The typical computer science major spends a tremendous amount time writing code, designing/developing systems, writing documentation, etc.. Across four years of study, you engross yourself in these technical artifacts integrating more and more complex ideas and jargon. Overtime, CS majors become quite adept at communicating with other technical experts: systems engineers, software developers, professors, etc.

But what about communicating with non-technical experts? Even the most technically adept software engineers will at some point need to communicate with a non-specialist product manager or business expert. Or what if someone in your local community asks you to describe what you work on?

With this gap in CS Education in mind, I developed a new course called _Communicating Computer Science_ designed specifically to allow students to:
1. Practice taking their technical expertise and trasnforming it for non-technical audiences.
2. Develop a portfolio piece that demonstrates their ability to communicate that can sit along side their code, projects, and more technical artifacts.

In this class we work together to a) examine how people in the real world communicate about computer science and b) practice how we might communicate computational ideas to various members of the public. The core idea is to explore cultural, practical, and policy-related roles of computer science communication in wider society.

We talk about how to communicate to various audiences (e.g. general public; press; policy makers; academics; etc.) and complete a number of practical assignments that help us practice our communication skills in various formats (i.e. talks; classes; interviews; etc.). Much of the class is centered on reading, watching, and critiquing existing computing-related materials (e.g. magazine/newspaper articles; TED Talks; media interviews; etc.). Other assignments are more practice focused with idea that each student will be able to select both the types of communication (e.g. spoken; written; YouTube video; etc.) and content (e.g. cryptocurrency; quantum computing; etc.) that are of interest to them for most assignments. The course culminates in a final project where students design a media artifact that tackles a deeply techincal topic of interest to them and targets a particular audience. You can see examples of these projects in the Project Gallery on this page.

The course is targeted towards CS/CE majors who are interested in:
* Communicating their own research to both academic and non-academic audiences
* Working in public outreach to spread awareness of CS
* Thinking about how we might inform policymakers of ideas in CS that have cultural and legal significance
